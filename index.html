                    Description: Thin slices of nopal fried with eggs, tomatoes, onions, served on a tortilla and garnished with a cheese of your choice.
                    <br>
                    Nopal is an extremely common ingredient where we live in Central Mexico. But first, what is <strong>nopal?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Our first few weeks in Mexico, I felt like I kept seeing nopal listed as a primary ingredient in several dishes, but I could not figure out what it was. In my translator app, <em>nopal</em> translated directly to <em>nopal</em>. On an outing with our Spanish teacher and her husband, Hector, I was tempted to order a nopal smoothie, just to find out what it was! Hector merely laughed and said I wouldn't like it. I asked him what "nopal" meant, and he said "Nopal is nopal!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At a restaurant, I saw a salad of steamed nopal with onions, which clued me in to it probably being a savory dish, and I started to suspect it was from a cactus by its vibrant green color and relatively flat shape. At the grocery store, I saw dried and puffed nopal snacks that looked like dry, green Cheetos, which didn't inspire a lot of confidence in them being true-to-life examples of what nopal <em>really</em> is. If I was going to try it, I was going to try it for real, not disguised into a bar food snack. Finally, I had my breakthrough at HEB when I saw a worker cleaning spines off what looked like prickly pear cactus nodes with a small machete. Directly in front of her were containers labeled "Nopales frescos," and more containers with the slightly more olive-toned cooked nopal salad-type mixture. Yes! Mystery solved!

                  <p>
                    There are many ways to use nopal, which I have heard compared in flavor and texture to okra. Not having had okra, I cannot confirm, but I will contend that it has a bright, citrusy flavor that makes for a wonderful brunch meal when paired with eggs, tomatoes, and onions and served on tortillas. That's what we will be making today!
